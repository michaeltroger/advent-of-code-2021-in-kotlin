Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [michaeltroger][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In this repository, michaeltroger is about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

**Special: The solutions are printed via [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://github.com/michaeltroger/advent-of-code-2021-in-kotlin/actions/workflows/build.yml) to the command line and saved as artificat.**
